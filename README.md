📋 Project Overview
This project aims to predict future demand for products based on historical sales data. Demand forecasting helps businesses make data-driven decisions for managing inventory levels, minimizing stockouts, and maximizing revenue.

Primary Objectives:

Analyze historical sales data to identify trends and patterns.
Build and evaluate predictive models for demand forecasting.
Provide insights for inventory and sales strategy optimization.
🗂️ Repository Structure
notebooks/: Contains Jupyter/Colab notebooks with exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and model-building code.
data/: Folder for datasets used in the project (excluded from the repository if the data is large or confidential).
src/: Python scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
README.md: Overview and documentation of the project.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies to reproduce the environment.
📊 Data Description
The data used for this project includes the following fields:

Sale Date: Date when the sale occurred.
Classification: Type of entry (e.g., sales, returns).
Location Code: Unique code for each retailer or location.
Product Code: Unique identifier for each product.
Quantity Sold: Number of units sold.
Product Details: Includes options like unit type, quantity in bundles or boxes, and product classification (e.g., large, medium, small categories).
Note: Ensure the dataset complies with all data privacy and usage regulations before use.

🔍 Data Analysis and Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Create new features from date/time columns, identify seasonality, trends, and aggregate data by product or category.
Data Transformation: Normalize or scale data as necessary for model input.
🔧 Modeling Approach
The project utilizes various machine learning models to determine the best-performing model for demand forecasting, including:

Baseline Models: Linear Regression, Moving Average
Advanced Models: ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) for time-series forecasting.
Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Modeling: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, StatsModels (for ARIMA), Facebook Prophet
Environment: Google Colab (for interactive development)

📈 Results
Summary of the best model's performance metrics, along with any key insights from the analysis. Include sample plots, such as demand trends, forecasted vs. actual demand, and residual analysis.

📝 Conclusion and Future Work
Conclusion: Summarize the project’s findings and the impact of the predictive model on demand forecasting accuracy.
Future Work: Suggest potential improvements, such as additional data sources, testing more complex models, or deploying the model in a production environment.
